# KWBungeeScript

This ruby script was written to automatically start and reset all our minigame servers at our network.
It will seamlessly communicate with our KWBungeeLobby, KWBungeeMinigame and KWBungee plugins.
You should really adapt this to your needs if you want to use it.

This script was specifically written for our `play.kwstudios.org` Bungee Network. It was not designed to work dynamically in every environment.
You may need to make changes in order for this script to work as you want.

Nevertheless you can use this script for whatever you want to, but be aware, there is ***no support*** for this
and if you create an issue with questions about how to run the script properly, we may never answer them.
